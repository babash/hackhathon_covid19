Ourfindings add to the existing findings from studies that have highlighted the negative economic impactof the pandemic and its association with anxiety or depression [98], as well as the overall negativepsychological effects of the pandemic on parents [99].Third, we found that the more stressed people felt, the less compliant they were with behaviouralguidelines; but also that more concerned individuals tended to display more behavioural compliance.These associations between compliance with local behavioural guidelines, and the psychologicalfactors of perceived stress and concern, respectively, differed across countries. Again, the earlyCOVID-19 period conformed to previous research showing that perceived stress and concern over apandemic related to people’s compliance (e.g. [17–19,31–33]). ",
